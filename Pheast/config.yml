## Point to the Pantry output directory containing BED files:
# phenotype_dir: ../Project/output
# Since the tables produced by the main test dataset may be too small for
# downstream analyses, the Pheast tests use another test dataset produced by
# Pheast/scripts/test_prepare_data.sh:
phenotype_dir: input/phenotypes

## Give the path prefix to genotypes in plink1 (bed/bim/fam) format:
geno_prefix: input/GEUVADIS.445_samples.GRCh38.chr1

## Samples to include:
samples_file: input/samples.txt

## Cluster job arguments for snakemake rules using GPU:
# Your snakemake profile configuration (e.g. ~/.config/snakemake/slurm/config.yaml)
# should include a `cluster` submission template string that includes
# `{resources.partition_etc}`. The config should also define `default-resources`
# that includes the default `partition_etc` string for CPU jobs. Then, define
# the GPU version of the string here, which will be used in the snakefile for
# rules that can utilize GPU to override the default `partition_etc`. This can
# include anything else needed for jobs on your cluster, such as `--account`. If
# not using cluster jobs, this will be ignored. To run everything on CPU, set
# this to the same string as the default `partition_etc`.
gpu_partition_etc: '--partition=gpu --gres=gpu:1'

## Optional parameters
# Provide a list of SNP IDs to include when computing TWAS weights:
# It is recommended to include only SNPs present in the LD reference used later for TWAS.
# twas_snps: /path/to/list/of/snps.txt
# Path to intermediate file directory, in case you don't want it inside this project directory due to its size:
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist, and will contain any generated (i.e. not input) files besides the final analysis results.
# intermediate_dir: intermediate

## Modalities
# List the modalities to use. The phenotype table ({modality}.bed.gz)
# must be present in the phenotype_dir, along with a
# {modality}.phenotype_groups.txt file in the case of grouped phenotypes.
modalities:
  # all:
  #   grouped: true
  alt_polyA:
    grouped: true
  # alt_TSS:
  #   grouped: true
  expression:
    grouped: false
  # isoforms:
  #   grouped: true
  # splicing:
  #   grouped: true
  # stability:
  #   grouped: false

## Analyses
# List the analyses to run. A snakefile will be loaded for each analysis,
# steps/{analysis}.smk, and results will be written to output/{analysis}/.
# {modality} will be replaced with each modality name.
analyses:
  heritability:
    files:
    - '{modality}.hsq.tsv'
  qtl:
    files:
    - '{modality}.cis_qtl.txt.gz'
    - '{modality}.cis_independent_qtl.txt.gz'
    # - '{modality}.trans_qtl.txt.gz'
