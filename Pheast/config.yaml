## Point to the Pantry output directory containing BED files:
# phenotype_dir: ../Project/output
# Since the tables produced by the main test dataset may be too small for
# downstream analyses, the Pheast tests use another test dataset produced by
# Pheast/scripts/test_prepare_data.sh:
phenotype_dir: input/phenotypes

## Give the path prefix to genotypes in plink1 (bed/bim/fam) format:
geno_prefix: input/GEUVADIS.445_samples.GRCh38.chr1

## Samples to include:
samples_file: input/samples.txt

## Phenotypes
# List the phenotype categories to use. The phenotype table ({phenotype}.bed.gz)
# must be present in the phenotype_dir, along with a
# {phenotype}.phenotype_groups.txt file in the case of grouped phenotypes.
phenotypes:
  alt_polyA:
    grouped: true
  alt_TSS:
    grouped: true
  expression:

    grouped: true
  stability:
    grouped: false

## Analyses
# List the analyses to run. A snakefile will be loaded for each analysis,
# steps/{analysis}.smk, and results will be written to output/{analysis}/.
# {phenotype} will be replaced with each phenotype name.
