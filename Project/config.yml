## Raw RNA-Seq data
paired_end: True
read_length: 75
fastq_dir: input/fastq
fastq_map: input/fastq_map.txt

## Reference files
# Download and unzip genome, e.g. http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-106/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
ref_genome: input/ref/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.chr1_0-2Mb.fa
# Download and unzip gene annotations, e.g. http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-106/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz
ref_anno: input/ref/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.chr1_0-2Mb.gtf

## Samples to include:
samples_file: input/samples.txt
## Approximate size of the genome in bp, e.g. 3e9 for full human genome
genome_size: 3e9

## Optional parameters
# Path to intermediate file directory, in case you don't want it inside this project directory due to its size:
# This directory will be created if it doesn't exist, and will contain any generated (i.e. not input) files besides the final phenotype outputs.
# intermediate_dir: intermediate
# Path to directory where intermediate reference files will be created:
# This will be in the intermediate dir by default, but can be specified to be outside the project dir.
# This could be useful if running multiple datasets with the same parameters, allowing the intermediate
# reference files to be generated once and shared by all the dataset runs.
# intermediate_ref_dir: intermediate/reference

## Modality groups
# List the modality groups to extract, with list of expected output files for each.
# A snakefile will be loaded for each group, steps/{groupname}.smk
# Each group represents one or more modalities that are generated from the same
# software.

  # latent:
  #   # Latent phenotyping uses PCA models that are often generated from multiple
  #   # datasets/tissues, but the steps before (generating coverage data) and
  #   # after (generating latent phenotypes) are run on each dataset. So by
  #   # default, the only output here is a flag file signifying the coverage data
  #   # is generated. You can then generate the models, uncomment the true output
  #   # files below, and generate the phenotypes. Or, if using pre-fit models,
  #   # specify the directory below, uncomment the phenotype files, and run it
  #   # all in one go.
